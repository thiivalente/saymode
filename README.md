# saymode
A shell script to helper the say using MacOS terminal

## Introduction
I saw the need to develop this code after getting sick and unable to speak, seeing the difficulty of using the say command, I decided to make it easier.

## Install

Give the permission to exec this file, after move to bin folder
```shell
chmod u+x saymode
cp saymode /usr/local/bin/
```
