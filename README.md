# saymode
A shell script to helper the speech using **MacOS**.

## Introduction
I saw the need to develop this code after getting sick and unable to speak, seeing the difficulty of using the ``say`` command, I decided to make it easier.

Apple allow using the ``say`` to speech using terminal, but is necessary repeat sometimes the command to say quickly or create longs phrases, but the problem is the time wasted on writing. 

## How to install?

### With terminal
Give the permission to exec this file, after move to bin folder.
> Open terminal
```shell
chmod u+x saymode
cp saymode /usr/local/bin/
```

## Use
Just call for saymode.
> Open Terminal
```shell
saymode
```
